# and leave your 'attempt' code in place (commented out if necessary) so we can see it.

                    R3 Radiosity (6p): done

As same as with previous assignment I've enjoyed working on current one, it is super cool when you instantly see what you a doing.
However, I haven't had enough time to do any extra this time, will try to change it in the future!
